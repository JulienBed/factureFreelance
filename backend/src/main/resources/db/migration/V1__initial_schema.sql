-- Initial database schema
-- This is a baseline migration for existing installations
-- New installations will run this migration to create the initial schema

-- Note: If your database already has these tables, Flyway will use baseline-on-migrate
-- to skip this migration and start from V2

-- This file serves as documentation of the initial schema
-- Actual table creation is handled by Hibernate for now
-- Future migrations will be managed by Flyway
